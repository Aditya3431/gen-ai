## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Aditya3431/gen-ai.git](https://github.com/Aditya3431/gen-ai.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd gen-ai
    ```
3.  (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv  # Or python -m venv .venv depending on your system
    source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4.  Install the required dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).

## Dependencies

The dependencies for each project are listed in their respective `requirements.txt` files (or similar).  You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
